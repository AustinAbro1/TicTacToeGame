# TicTacToeGame
Created using sockets and JavaFX that launched two separate clients for each user to use. Used problem-solving skills to efficiently send information to each user instantly. First run the game server file (ToeFXGameServer.java), then you must launch two clients (run the ToeFXGameClientFX.java file twice) to play, first client will always be 'X" and second will be 'O'.
